BAMAZON app


Bamazon is a CLI (command line interface) application using mySQL database and node.js. To run this application open it in git or other terminal.

The customer side app called bamazonCustomer.js is working by displaying all the products first prompting the ustomer to select one of the products by id input. After the item is selected the user nters quntity of the product. If the quntity is sufficient the customer sees the total cost in the command line as well as updating the current stock quantity on the database side.

Here is a gif on how the program works.
